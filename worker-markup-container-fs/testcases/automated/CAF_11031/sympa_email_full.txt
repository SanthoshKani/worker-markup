This tends to be the most up-to-date resource for information:

https://hpedia.osp.hpe.com/wiki/OpenVPN

If you find something different,  please update the wiki.

I use both openvpn on 16.04 as well as openconnect with the
juniper gateways:

I find openconnect to have somewhat better latency but it
does seem susceptible to 'noise' that causes connections to
occasionally drop.
